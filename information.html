                              We love the fact they mate for life. One litter of pups is born in the spring and often the one-year-olds will help their parents care for the next, younger generation of pups.  Plus, they are great parents and will even care for another wolf’s babies, given the chance.  Also, they are very shy and don’t want to be around you or your house. It is very rare you will ever encounter one.  Red wolves weigh between 45 and 80 pounds. They are smaller than a gray wolf but larger than a coyote.
                              All wolves, including red wolves, help keep coyotes out of the area where they live. They are the apex predator and will run out or kill coyotes entering their territories.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Timber wolves, also known as gray wolves or Canis lupus, are majestic creatures that have captured the imagination of humans for centuries. These remarkable animals are known for their complex social structure, impressive hunting abilities, and iconic howls that echo through the wilderness. As one of the largest members of the canine family, timber wolves have a distinct appearance with their shaggy coat, sharp teeth, and piercing eyes.</p>

                                          <p class="card-text">As the largest members of the canine family, GREY WOLVES, can actually be white, black, tan, brown or grizzled—a combination of tan, brown and black. A wolf's lifespan is an average of seven years in the wild and twelve in captivity. Wolves have strong jaws, with 42 teeth—20 on their upper jaws and 22 on their lower jaws—making for the largest bite pressure of any canid. Wolves are known to crush large bones in just a few bites.  <span><strong>At one time gray wolves had the largest natural ranges of any terrestrial mammal in the northern hemisphere.</strong></span> Human expansion in the western states displaced the wolves and conflict began. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 reestablished wolf populations and provided legal protection of unregulated killing and poisoning of gray wolves by humans. By  2010 the population had reached a successful size in the Rocky Mountains.</p>
