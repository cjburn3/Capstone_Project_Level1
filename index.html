  <p class ="p5-class">Wolves are the largest members of the canid family. This is the species from which our domesticated dogs share a common ancestor with. Wolves were once the most widely distributed, wild terrestrial mammals. They inhabited most of the available land in the northern hemisphere. Due to the destruction of their habitat and persecution by humans, they now occupy only about two-thirds of their former range worldwide, and only about 5-8 percent of the contiguous 48 United States. Wolves can be found in a variety of climates and habitats. These habitat variations are sometimes seen in the type of morphology, or physical characteristics, seen in gray wolves living in different geographical areas. These differences sometimes differentiate types, or subspecies, of gray wolves around the world.</p>

                            We love the fact they mate for life. One litter of pups is born in the spring and often the one-year-olds will help their parents care for the next, younger generation of pups.  Plus, they are great parents and will even care for another wolf’s babies, given the chance.  Also, they are very shy and don’t want to be around you or your house. It is very rare you will ever encounter one.  Red wolves weigh between 45 and 80 pounds. They are smaller than a gray wolf but larger than a coyote.
                            All wolves, including red wolves, help keep coyotes out of the area where they live. They are the apex predator and will run out or kill coyotes entering their territories.</p>

These remarkable animals are known for their complex social structure, impressive hunting abilities, and iconic howls that echo through the wilderness. As one of the largest members of the canine family, timber wolves have a distinct appearance with their shaggy coat, sharp teeth, and piercing eyes.</p>

A wolf's lifespan is an average of seven years in the wild and twelve in captivity. Wolves have strong jaws, with 42 teeth—20 on their upper jaws and 22 on their lower jaws—making for the largest bite pressure of any canid. Wolves are known to crush large bones in just a few bites.  <span><strong>At one time gray wolves had the largest natural ranges of any terrestrial mammal in the northern hemisphere.</strong></span> Human expansion in the western states displaced the wolves and conflict began. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 reestablished wolf populations and provided legal protection of unregulated killing and poisoning of gray wolves by humans. By  2010 the population had reached a successful size in the Rocky Mountains.</p>
